--p4c, a reference compiler that supports several backends and easily integrates into vendor-specific backends. --p4c-bmv2 – targets the behavioral model --p4c-ebpf – targets the Extended Berkeley Packet Framework --p4c-graphs – produces parser and table flow graph diagrams --p4test – a simple frontend verifier for P4 programs --behavioral-model, a simulation environment to run the P4 software switch, standalone or in Mininet. --p4runtime, a specification and Protobuf/gRPC interface definition for a runtime API to control data plane programs. --PI is a reference implementation for P4Runtime --p4runtime-shell is an interactive Python shell for P4Runtime based on IPython --ptf, a packet test framework that interfaces with P4Runtime to enable switch configuration and test creation. --p4app, a Docker container pre-packaged with a development environment to easily compile and deploy P4 programs using configuration rules. --pna, ongoing work that will lead to a published Portable NIC Architecture specification --p4app-switchML, accelerates the all-reduce communication primitive commonly used by distributed Machine Learning frameworks.
